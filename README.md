# Project Tracking 3
This repository contains a project-tracking application that I Know Some Guys used for a while, and serves now as an example of building a moderately-complex app using the frostillic.us Framework.

It consists of two NSF on-disk projects: "iksg-pt-3", the XPages application, and "iksg-pt3-data", the faceless data-storage DB, meant to be inaccessible from the web.

I'm not sure if it will run nowadays, but it probably will. However, the layout expects the presence of my [WrapBootstrap Ace library](https://github.com/jesse-gallagher/Miscellany), which in turn is an implementation of a no-longer-for-sale commercial Bootstrap theme. So this is better treated as a source for ideas and examples, not a functioning application.
